SMUD - SlightMUD

I wrote this MUD in 2000 as an entry to the 16k MUD competition (see below), as you can see it grew well beyond those tight bounds into something that was a lot of fun for a lot of people.

As with most MUDs, enthusiasm died out in time and the code has sat in a CVS archive since about 2005.  It isn't perfect and has kept its flagrant use of static arrays but I loved writing and playing it, so I thought I'd dig it out and shove it on github.

USAGE:

If you're mad enough to want to try and use it then please do so.  The code compiles on 16.04 as is, but here's a quick guide to building:

You'll need to uncomment UU.rank=GOD into src/login.c so your first user gets immortal(admin) status then remove it after, or write a nice little routine for it.

Also other/fund.def (set to 100k on first run) is the maximum gold for the game, I had plans to turn this into a limited economy but never really got around to it.

First compile libmff in its own directory
Then compile the main code in the src directory, you might need to edit the Makefile and set the UNAME to be 'Linux' or 'FREEBSD', also you need to use pmake/bmake.
After that it should run quite nicely from the src directory with a ./smud on port 4000

FEATURES:

I've forgotten a lot of what the mud can do, but heres a go:

Areas
Guilds
Skill tree
Spells
Groups
Visualish area generator
Transportation
News
Debate system
Weather
Homerooms
Basic scripting
MCCP
Economy... it's quite basic!
and more...

NOTES:

It wasn't finished (what ever is!) and a lot of the features could do with more effort, but it is an easy codebase to work with and if you're in the mind to host a MUD, you could do a lot worse.

PULL REQUESTS:

More than happy to recieve them
